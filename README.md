============

Tasting Notes Source Code

Tasting Notes is a universal iOS app for wine drinkers to keep track of their tasting notes.  What makes Tasting Notes
different then most apps like this is the ability to create custom notebooks.  Users can change the content
and layout of the notebook in the app.  They can also create different types of notebooks if they wish.

The original version of Tasting Notes was powered by a SQLite database and depeneded on SQL, but this version
is being recoded with Core Data.
